        If we were actually rendering different tabs on a single page,
        we would include the additional <dl> trees here. The 'inactive' tabs would
        be conditionally rendered and/or have "display:none" styling conditionally applied,
        which would toggle upon clicking the corresponding tab.
        For now, they're mocked as separate HTML pages.
