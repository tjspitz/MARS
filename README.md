# MARS
This is a repo of repos, if you will. It contains notes and work completed, small and large, whilst interning with the MARS program.

Currently... 

- my notes as well as assignments reflect previous experience in the technologies covered up to present
- however, I am eager to begin learning Java, via the SpringBoot framework, soon
- the repo is organized in a "daily folder" fashion with notes and experiments, as well as assignment work within a subfolder:

```
|----MARS
|    |----folder_by_date
|         |----assignment(s)
|              index.html
|              styles.css
|              main.js
|         index.css
|         styles.css
|         main.js
|    |----folder_by_date
|         etc...
```
