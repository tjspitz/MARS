    <h1>This is a super-cool page</h1>
    <div class="main-content">
      <p>Welcome to this amazing page! It's full of amazing things!</p>
      <p>
        Well, it might be slightly lacking in amazing things, but it has plenty of HTML.
        Who knows, maybe there&apos;s even some CSS!
      </p>
      <p>Oh, and there&apos;s definitely some escaped HTML characters here and there. But you won't see them unless you open your dev tools in the browser...</p>
