# What the heck is going on in this directory?

This directory contains ONLY THE FILES WHICH ARE RELEVANT
to any assignment(s) given for this particular day.
They WILL NOT work properly in this directory, which should be obvious.
<br>
<br>
If you wish to see them behaving in a useful manner,
insert them into the `reactSprint/11_6_23/assignments` directory
in their appropriate directory.
<br>
<br>
You may also need to modify `index.js` and `index.css`
within the `reactSprint/11_6_23/assignments` directory
in order for the correct components to render, and proper styles to be applied.
